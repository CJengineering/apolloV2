Professor <a href=\"/people/elfatih-eltahir\" id=\"\">Elfatih Eltahir</a> explains that the work was inspired by the realisation that “people’s understanding of climate change is based on the assumption that climate change is something that’s going to happen sometime in the future and going to happen to someone else. It’s not going to impact them directly. And I think that contributes to the fact that we are not doing enough.”</p>",

It’s important, therefore, for the world to be ready – not just with treatments, vaccinations, messaging, stockpiled resources, individuals with the necessary skill sets and healthy populations to begin with (e.g. those with no obesity, underlying disease, and so on), but also with the ability to scale up responses and act quickly.\"</p><p>He continues, \"Research funded by philanthropic foundations like Community Jameel is crucial to unlocking all the lessons from the last pandemic, and other disease outbreaks, to improve our response to future threats. Within Imperial, we’ve been undertaking retrospective analyses to answer questions like how to best apply and use limited vaccine stockpiles; how to quantify the real-world impact of different intervention methods; how different communities and sub-populations were affected differently during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how we can better protect these communities in future.\"</p>",

    "excerpt": "<p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Simon Mundy: </strong>What exactly is the proposal you’re making?</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Esther Duflo:</strong> The point I’m making is very simple. I’m trying to put a number for the moral debt that rich people of the world — particularly people in rich countries — have towards the poor people of the world related to our consumption choices, and thereby our carbon emissions.</p><p id=\"\">And how do I compute this number? I focus on mortality: on the greatest cost of all, which is losing your life.</p><p id=\"\">Poor people face a double jeopardy vis-à-vis climate change. The first problem is that they tend to live in places that are already hot. And therefore, as the planet warms, there’ll be more and more days above 35C, particularly in those countries. </p><p id=\"\">And then the second problem they have is, of course, they’re poor. And poverty is a big impediment to adapt to climate change. We can see that people are much more likely to die with a particular number of days above 35C in poor countries, even if they are used to heat.</p><p id=\"\">So if you put these two things together, you get this really remarkable map that was <a href=\"https://archive.ph/o/P0CIl/https://impactlab.org/news-insights/global-death-rate-from-rising-temperatures/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">made by the Global Impact Lab</a>, which shows there is going to be massive damage: about 6mn extra deaths a year until 2100. And this damage will be concentrated in poor countries outside the OECD [group of developed economies].</p><p id=\"\">The second part of the argument, of course, is that the majority of the damage is still done by us [in rich countries]. So if we take into account consumption, the carbon footprint of the 10 per cent richest Americans is 122 times larger than that of the median African.</p><p id=\"\">Every tonne of carbon we put into the atmosphere imposes a cost. And we can focus on the mortality cost, because that’s the most striking. You combine the effect of one tonne of carbon on global warming, multiplied by the effect of temperature on mortality, multiplied by a value that you put on one year of life — the number that our governments keep using, which is the “value of a statistical life”. </p><p id=\"\">If you combine these three numbers, you get basically the money value of the cost of carbon in the air. [University of Chicago economist] Michael Greenstone and his team <a href=\"https://archive.ph/o/P0CIl/https://impactlab.org/research/valuing-the-global-mortality-consequences-of-climate-change-accounting-for-adaptation-costs-and-benefits/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">estimated it to be $37 a tonne</a>. So, take $37 a tonne, multiply by 14bn tonnes a year of carbon emissions — that’s the total footprint, including consumption, of Europe and the US. And you get about a little over $500bn a year. That’s the damage that we impose on poor countries, just the mortality damage. Just from the rich part of the world to the poor part of the world.</p><p id=\"\">So that’s what I call a moral debt. This is not what it would cost to adapt; this is not what it would cost to mitigate. This is what we owe. That’s the first point.</p><p id=\"\">The second point is: how are we going to find this money? Until now, we’ve not been very good at it. There is a <a href=\"https://archive.ph/o/P0CIl/https://www.ft.com/content/59b86449-7567-4458-926e-1c382ba2bc3d\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">loss and damage fund</a>; there is no money in it. I think there is a grand sum of $700mn, which is kind of ridiculous.</p><p id=\"\">So to break the logjam, what I’m proposing is: let’s look for new sources of funding that we don’t have yet — and therefore, have not yet been assigned to anything — and that are not implausible, that could conceivably exist.</p><p id=\"\">The minimum tax on corporations has been fixed at 15 per cent [<a href=\"https://archive.ph/o/P0CIl/https://www.ft.com/content/191d8388-c5c0-419c-95d6-918df6f09fc5\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">under an international agreement</a>]. But originally, the number that was proposed was 25. So I’m thinking, well, there is maybe a bit of margin. And if you went from 15 to 18 per cent, you could raise about $200bn a year.</p><p id=\"\">And then, in February, the G20 discussed the <a href=\"https://archive.ph/o/P0CIl/https://www.taxobservatory.eu/gabriel-zucmans-address-at-the-g20-finance-ministers-meeting-on-february-29-2024/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">proposal of Gabriel Zucman and the EU Tax Observatory</a> of a tax on the super-rich — a tax of 2 per cent yearly on the wealth of the 3,000 richest billionaires. That would raise $300bn. So if you combine these two, you get to your $500bn.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">SM: </strong>This is only one element of the mortality — there are deaths attributable to droughts and storms and floods . . . </p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">ED: </strong>It’s very partial in many ways. First of all, it’s just heat. It doesn’t include the disasters. The second way in which it is partial, of course, is that mortality is not the only damage. There is also damage to agriculture, there is the cost of adaptation . . . the total social cost of carbon is much higher.</p><p id=\"\">So why just take mortality? First of all, it’s very clear that this is a cost imposed on poor countries. The second reason is that one could argue with everything else. But how can we argue with the fact that our behaviour is killing people, and that this is worthy of compensation?</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">SM: </strong>This dovetails with the International Tax Task Force that was <a href=\"https://archive.ph/o/P0CIl/https://www.ft.com/content/46b675d1-873d-4be9-a429-f4ebd9651068\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">announced at COP28</a> in December by [French economist] Laurence Tubiana and [Barbados climate envoy] Avinash Persaud, on using tax to meet some of the costs of climate change. They talked to me about how the numbers needed for climate action in developing countries seem very big. But even bigger are the numbers for fossil fuel subsidies, the numbers for fossil fuel profits, the numbers for corporate profits in general — and the tax revenues that you could generate through targeted taxes.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">ED:</strong> I have chatted with Laurence about this, and this very much dovetails with that effort. What is interesting with this $500bn number is that OK, it looks big, but it’s not really that big. There are two instruments [in my proposal], and they are not going to weigh on the middle class in rich countries. They’re not going to be a big burden on the ultra-rich, because 2 per cent of their wealth is only 30 per cent of their income from their wealth, which is currently untaxed. I think we need to rely on taxation because that is the way in which traditionally we ensure that everyone in the economy, private companies and individuals, contributes to the public good. And the two instruments I propose — they are not necessarily the only ones possible, but they will be sufficient to raise the money.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">SM: </strong>You’ve famously been an economist who puts a lot of emphasis on empirical data. How has that informed this proposal?</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">ED:</strong> In many places. The mortality estimates that I rely upon, computed by the Global Impact lab — the empirical work is super, super serious and robust, using historical data from tens of thousands of micro-regions.</p><p id=\"\">Another is in my comfort with taxation, which, again, is based on a lot of empirical work that shows that rich people will not stop working or inventing because taxation is higher. They might try to escape. But that’s why we need international collaboration. If there is international collaboration, if we manage to have uniform taxation of companies and individuals, it’s not going to have a big efficiency cost on the functioning of the economy.</p><p id=\"\">And the third point is how the money would be used. This is where my own work comes in much more directly. So how would we use the money most effectively to compensate people, but also to protect them? That’s why I propose, as one big outlet for the fund, direct cash transfers to people, which would be triggered by climate events.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">SM: </strong>I’ve <a href=\"https://archive.ph/o/P0CIl/https://www.ft.com/content/5c931d2a-acb5-4b98-9b1d-07a00eb8b38c\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">written a bit</a> about direct cash transfers, and it seems there is a growing amount of data to suggest that this is effective.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">ED:</strong> We have tonnes of evidence that people are using this money very well. And with the technology we have today, everyone in the world could be connected to a bank account, connecting everyone to a cash transfer that could be automatically triggered by climate events. This is not the stuff of science fiction at all. Togo is putting that infrastructure in place, and it is perfectly possible to do it in other places.</p><p id=\"\">A second use of the money that I propose: people are very badly insured in poor countries; the insurance market has not really managed to penetrate. So when there is a problem, it’s the government that has to step in. But the governments themselves are not very well insured. So it can become too much for them. And we saw during Covid, the rich countries were able to spend about 27 per cent of their GDP on fiscal stimulus measures, and the poorest countries 2 per cent. So I think there should be a role for automatic payments to governments in response to disasters.</p><p id=\"\">The third thing is that there is a need to develop and scale up adaptation measures to deal with climate change. Things as simple as making sure there are cool places for people to go to in cities, to trickier things such as drought-resistant crop varieties.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">SM: </strong>Let’s come back to the question of tax. It sounds like you think tax rates are too low on high earners, too low on companies. What if you were in charge of taxes globally? Or perhaps just in the US or France? How would you change the tax system?</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">ED:</strong> Well, in a sense, that’s a bigger question than this one. And I’m not sure I want to go there because people might think I’m a dangerous extremist. Whereas this thing is not an extremist proposal at all; this is extraordinarily reasonable.</p><p id=\"\">Let me say one thing: the US has a fiscal deficit issue, which is structural. It should do something to reduce its deficit — I think that everyone kind of agrees to that. It also only taxes 25 per cent of GDP, compared with the Nordic countries that are taxing 40 per cent to 45 per cent. So clearly, there is some fiscal margin in the US . . . that’s it, I’ll stop there.</p><p id=\"\">In terms of the ultra-rich, I think everyone has recognised the fundamental unfairness in the fact that the ultra-rich are not being taxed on the income that they are making from their wealth. You are being taxed on the income you’re making by interviewing me; I’m being taxed on the income I’m making as an academic. But if we are sufficiently wealthy to have a lot of money invested in various places, and we keep reinvesting this money, we never have to take it out, and therefore, we are never taxed on it. If [the super-rich] want to consume, in a lot of cases, they will borrow against their wealth. So it’s a loan, not an “income” — so they are not taxed on it. That seems to be fundamentally unfair. </p><p id=\"\">So if you go back to the idea of the 2 per cent tax on wealth — think about it as a tax on the income of this wealth. If someone is making, let’s say, a 6 per cent return on their wealth — a 2 per cent tax on the wealth is simply a third of that 6 per cent. So that just amounts to an average tax of 30 per cent on the income from their wealth. That’s probably less than what you pay. </p><p id=\"\">But it needs to be done globally, because these people have enough wherewithal that, you know, if Elon Musk’s fortune is being taxed in the US, he can always move it. So that’s why it needs to be done as a co-ordinated effort. </p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">SM:</strong> What is your sense of how the political winds are blowing right now? Do you think your proposal is really possible politically?</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">ED:</strong> I think there is clear political momentum for a minimum taxation of the super-rich. I don’t think it will happen today or tomorrow, but I think it is really much more out in the open as something that is reasonable.</p><p id=\"\">As far as my proposal . . . in shopping around this proposal in the past year, I used to get more polite yeses with everyone saying, “Oh, that sounds like a cool idea”. Which is a sign that they haven’t really listened to me at all. Now people are asking, “But where should the money be housed? And what is going to be the governance?” Much more concrete questions, which makes me think that it actually might be exactly the right moment. </p><p id=\"\">I want to believe that it will happen. It’s really necessary. And it’s reasonable. It’s not that hard.</p>",

    "excerpt": "<p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Q: </strong>According to the King Climate Action Initiative (K-CAI), any attempt to address poverty effectively must also simultaneously address climate change. Why is that?</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">A: </strong>Climate change will disproportionately harm people in poverty, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, because they tend to live in places that are more exposed to climate risk. These are nations in sub-Saharan Africa and South and Southeast Asia where low-income communities rely heavily on agriculture for their livelihoods, so extreme weather — heat, droughts, and flooding — can be devastating for people’s jobs and food security. In fact, the World Bank estimates that up to 130 million more people may be pushed into poverty by climate change by 2030.</p><p id=\"\">This is unjust because these countries have historically emitted the least; their people didn’t cause the climate crisis. At the same time, they are trying to improve their economies and improve people’s welfare, so their energy demands are increasing, and they are emitting more. But they don’t have the same resources as wealthy nations for mitigation or adaptation, and many developing countries understandably don’t feel eager to put solving a problem they didn’t create at the top of their priority list. This makes finding paths forward to cutting emissions on a global scale politically challenging.</p><p id=\"\">For these reasons, the problems of enhancing the well-being of people experiencing poverty, addressing inequality, and reducing pollution and greenhouse gases are inextricably linked.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Q: </strong>So how does K-CAI tackle this hybrid challenge?</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">A: </strong>Our initiative is pretty unique. We are a competitive, policy-based research and development fund that focuses on innovating, testing, and scaling solutions. We support researchers from MIT and other universities, and their collaborators, who are actually implementing programs, whether NGOs [nongovernmental organizations], government, or the private sector. We fund pilots of small-scale ideas in a real-world setting to determine if they hold promise, followed by larger randomized, controlled trials of promising solutions in climate change mitigation, adaptation, pollution reduction, and energy access. Our goal is to determine, through rigorous research, if these solutions are actually working — for example, in cutting emissions or protecting forests or helping vulnerable communities adapt to climate change. And finally, we offer path-to-scale grants which enable governments and NGOs to expand access to programs that have been tested and have strong evidence of impact.</p><p id=\"\">We think this model is really powerful. Since we launched in 2020, we have built a portfolio of over 30 randomized evaluations and 13 scaling projects in more than 35 countries. And to date, these projects have informed the scale ups of evidence-based climate policies that have reached over 15 million people.</p>",

My bus arrived and I never got to ask him what made the Plaam cake more special.I have always treasured that memory as an example of the unique place of Christmas in urban (and perhaps even rural) Indian culture. Those cakes were clearly not for some cosmopolitan elite from the city’s more prosperous areas.

This can be difficult in a country like India where women often face discrimination and barriers to justice seem pervasive, a problem exacerbated by the low numbers of women police officers. There has been a big push from the Indian government in recent years to create a policing system that is sensitive to the needs of women. Scientific evidence can be a powerful tool to this end.</p><p>India recorded an estimated 51 complaints of crimes against women every hour in 2022, as per the National Crimes Records Bureau. The actual number is likely to be much higher because women often hesitate to report crimes against them, in part because of social stigma.</p><p>For over two decades, India’s ministry of home affairs has called for special measures to curb crimes against women (CAW). Over the last few years, India’s federal and state governments have also introduced a reservation system for women in the police force, set up special helplines as well as all-women police stations. Their utility continues to be a subject of intense debate.</p>",

The desks, known as Urgent Relief and Just Action (URJA), underwent rigorous evaluation by the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab in 2019 and were found to lead to an increase in cases of gender-based violence, especially when they were staffed by female officers.

It was around that year when the Bihar government announced hiring over 80,000 para-teachers (<em id=\"\">shiksha-mitras</em>) to be placed in government schools. As a young field research associate, I found myself in the hinterlands of Bihar over the next month, assisting the <a href=\"https://www.pratham.org/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Pratham</a> teams as they painstakingly traveled across 150 locations in Bihar’s far flung districts, training a core team of government master trainers who would then go on to train these para-teachers. It was no small task. In the true Pratham style of learning by doing, training was not imparted through classroom sessions; rather, hundreds of master trainers were taken to the field and engaged in daily practice classes with children. Pratham could have chosen the traditional in-classroom training which would have been less of a logistical challenge, and the trainees would also have been happy to catch that much needed mid-afternoon nap. But taking the harder path taught us all an invaluable lesson:<strong id=\"\"> </strong>how to get master-trainers to do the practice classes in a do-it-yourself style, at a large scale, with quality and rigour, who can then percolate their experience to the teachers. </p>",

    "excerpt": "<p id=\"\">The experiment took place in Kenya and involved two groups of poor people chosen at random. Those in group A would receive a fixed payment every month for 12 years. Those in group B would be given the same monthly stipend but only for two years. Which of the two groups would be more likely <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2024-03-07/latin-america-must-double-its-annual-investment-in-energy-to-make-the-green-transition-by-2030.html\" id=\"\">to invest</a>? Abhijit Banerjee, 63, was one of the people in charge of the experiment, and he was expecting to find more investors among those in group B. His reasoning was the following: in group B, where payments would end after two years, the urgency to develop a business venture allowing people to maintain the same level of financial well-being must surely be greater than in A, where the 12 years of payments would provide some peace of mind to the recipients.</p><p id=\"\">As the reader may have already imagined, the result was just the opposite. “We were surprised to find that the people whose monthly payments lasted the longest were also the ones who invested the most,” Banerjee said in an interview with EL PAÍS during a recent visit to Madrid to talk about poverty at the Ramón Areces Foundation. Peace of mind was the key variable, yes, but not because it caused inaction, rather the opposite: the guarantee that payments would continue to arrive for 12 years worked as the safety net that allowed people <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/society/2023-04-04/todays-entrepreneur-no-longer-wants-to-be-rich-just-happy.html\" id=\"\">to try out business ventures</a>.</p><p id=\"\">After more than 20 years devoted to the subject, Banerjee is no newcomer to the field of poverty alleviation. In 2019 he received the Nobel Prize in economics together with his wife, Esther Duflo, and the academic who inspired them both, Michael Kremer, for their research on poverty following the method that the pharmaceutical industry uses to develop medicines: randomised controlled trials (also called RCTs) in which there is a treatment group and a control group to compare measurements.</p>",

Mortality rates among Americans dropped 0.5% for every 1% jump in an area’s unemployment rate during the Great Recession, according to the report.

One of the key explanations it identified for a longer life was cleaner air, linked to recession-induced reductions in pollution.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">On a broader level, the report begs the question: Is a better economy worth having a shorter life? And brings into consideration alternative economic models such as the de-growth model, an economic theory which advocates for the scaling back of production and consumption, which, it writes, can be “a purposeful strategy to stabilise economies and achieve social and ecological goals.\"</p>",

At the same time, the way pesticides are delivered is not ideal: The only way to guarantee enough pesticide distribution is to spray too much. That isn’t great for farmers’ wallets or the environment.</p><p id=\"\">Along comes <a href=\"https://www.agzen.com/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">AgZen</a>, a company born out of over a decade of MIT engineering research, with a new solution that uses AI to ensure that the plants get sprayed just enough, using real-time adjustments to optimise the use of pesticide. The company’s CEO, Vishnu Jayaprakash, shared with TechCrunch that RealCoverage can detect droplets as small as 150 microns and can offer real-time adjustments to spray parameters like pressure, rate, boom height, or speed. This allows for maximum application efficiency at speeds of up to 12 mph, the company claims.</p><p id=\"\">The implications of this technology are vast. AgZen claims that its algorithms and optimisations can reduce chemical usage by up to 50%, significantly lowering input costs for farmers while maintaining crop health and yield. AgZen has been testing its product through more than three years of field trials on various crops and tells TechCrunch that last year it conducted 12 successful pilots and trials across the U.S. and Europe with some of the largest growers in the world.</p>",

A video work by Mohammed Al Faraj comes with an agreement with the artist that he can re-edit the work every year or so, while a rubber floor work by Hemali Bhuta will gradually disintegrate over time.</p><p id=\"\">Then there is his smaller, private collection, influenced by his interest in East Asian cultures: a Japanese-inspired koi fish pond spans the ground floor of his home in Dubai.

This program works closely with ‘didis’ or women from poorest of the poor households, especially those belonging to particularly vulnerable tribal groups, to support them in breaking out of cyclical poverty by building durable and resilient livelihoods, ensuring food security, enabling access to government entitlements and active participation in social and financial institutions. &nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">The graduation ceremony held at Aryabhatta Auditorium, Ranchi University was attended by C.P.

He said, “It is also important to partner with the government to implement any program at scale and also to ensure last-mile delivery. Over a period of time, The Nudge Institute has successfully done this and is working in Rajasthan, Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya, Karnataka, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Punjab. In all these states, it is closely working with the State Rural Livelihood Missions, DAY-NRLM of the Ministry of Rural Development and the Ministry of Social Justice &amp; Empowerment of the Government of India. In 2024, The Nudge Institute aims to work with Two Lakh rural ultra-poor families in the country.”</p><p id=\"\">Started in Jharkhand in 2018, to enable the poorest of poor families to progress out of poverty through empowering the women, this is the second cohort graduating from the program. The first cohort of 400 didis graduated in December 2022. The/Nudge Institute contextualized the ‘Graduation approach’ to Jharkhand’s context in the districts of Lohardaga, Latehar and Gumla. The Graduation approach’s efficacy is reflected in the evaluation published by Nobel Laureates Dr Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo. The/Nudge has expanded its direct implementation now to Rajasthan and Karnataka with support of philanthropic donors to learn and continuously improve the program design.</p>",

Each film addresses a particular environmental crisis facing present-day India by tracing its origins back through the centuries. The films are presented in a kind of lecture style, with Abhijit appearing as the narrator, unraveling historical details, as graphics by Sarnath visualize the story with an often wry and easy wit. The results apply logic and narrative coherence to problems with complex roots in the forces of nature, economics, and local culture. </p><p id=\"\">“The Land of Good Intentions” explores the conditions and policies that led to mass protests by farmers, in Punjab and elsewhere, following the passage of farming legislation in September 2020. The film begins by providing historical context from multiple angles, including the significance of rice to regional culture, its growing conditions (which require a lot of water), the region’s climate (which produces very little), and previous government subsidies that led to its overproduction. The 2020 Farm Bills were intended to address rice overproduction and its consequences, including the depletion of Punjab’s groundwater supply, pollution from the burning of rice stalks, and a surplus going to waste. But farmers considered that they were being asked to shoulder the costs of a problem the government created. </p>",

    "excerpt": "<p id=\"\">I was six when I first tasted Chinese food.</p><p id=\"\">Pigeon Roast in a restaurant called Eros, at the edge of Kolkata’s crumbling ‘New’ Market, a plump little bird rich with what I now know to be the flavours of soy and ginger. It was love at first bite. I lobbied to go back, but the inflationary explosion of the 1960s quickly ate into my parents’ fixed salaries, and we ate out much less. The restaurant closed, and I never got to verify whether the miracle I remembered was genuine.</p><p id=\"\">Chinese food stayed with me. On the rare occasion when we went out, it was often Chinese. Hakka chowmein was my favourite — best when rich in chopped cabbage, carrots, French beans, and bits of chicken or pork. I loved steamed bhetki dressed with generous amounts of chopped ginger and scallions in soy-flavoured sauce. And the marvellous chimney soup, (pork?) broth simmering at your table with different vegetables, meats and many types of seafood.</p><p>However, by then, the 200-year-old Kolkata Chinese community was shrinking. From more than 20,000 in the 1950s, it is now a mere couple of thousand. Economic opportunity had brought them to Kolkata when it was party central for Britain’s grand Bengali bonanza. By the 1960s, that party was well over: years of silting left the river too shallow for large modern ships — Kolkata port was mostly dead. Time was also running out on the city’s 19th-century smoke-stack industries. Like Manchester or Mumbai, Kolkata needed to reinvent itself, but bad policy and industrial strife got in the way. For the local Chinese community, it was time to move on, as they had many times before. Hakka, the name of the community that gave us the noodles, actually means guests (or migrants) — they had a long history of moving south from the very north of China.</p>"

Meeting these goals will require jurisdictions to work in new ways, experimenting with strategies that may not yet have an evidence base. Carrie Cihak, King County evidence and impact officer, called for more shared learning among jurisdictions to build a knowledge base and ultimately drive more rapid change. “We are often measuring—or just estimating—inputs and outputs rather than really rigorously understanding whether our actions are making a difference in our communities,” she said, emphasising the need to conduct rigorous, randomised evaluations in order to understand the causal impact of programmes and whether they are making a difference in King County communities. &nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">J-PAL affiliated researcher Peter Christensen (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign), noted that many researchers focused in the climate arena are interested in evaluating the underlying mechanisms—often behavioural mechanisms—of climate programmes that aren't well understood. Peter emphasised that better understanding the human behaviour aspects of climate and transportation interventions, such as how individuals take-up or engage with programmes, “could potentially have a very large impact on emissions reductions, poverty alleviation, or equity impacts of climate programmes.”</p><p id=\"\">Rachel Brown, research associate at King County Metro, added that incorporating programme evaluation early on can help both clarify program mechanisms and ensure policies are being implemented equitably. She encouraged governments to ask more questions about who is bearing the burden of new policies, “who are we asking to make changes to their lives and live more sustainably?” </p>",

    "excerpt": "<p id=\"\">Most organizations are fairly well acquainted with the basics of generative AI, but few have put together a vision and road map for executing the still-fledging technology at enterprise scale. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.societegenerale.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Société Générale</a>, the sixth-largest bank in Europe, is ahead of the pack, according to chief digital strategy officer Noémie Ellezam. The 150-year-old company supports 25 million clients daily, providing retail, corporate, and investment banking services as well as those specific to insurance, private banking, and securities. Innovation is central to Société Générale’s charter, and AI technologies, now including generative AI, have long been a pillar of the company’s digital transformation strategy.</p><p id=\"\">“AI is an accelerator of our digital strategy, with potential impact across all of our businesses and business areas,” Ellezam said during <a href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/finding-transformation-opportunities-with-generative-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">a webinar</a> hosted by MIT Sloan Management Review and sponsored by Skillsoft. Banks have been using AI and advanced analytics for years, with use cases such as real-time payments and fraud and overdraft management. “Generative AI is a very big step on the AI journey, but it’s just a step, not a complete shift,” she said.</p><p id=\"\">Financial services institutions could see a 3% to 5% productivity boost from generative AI, but those gains won’t be reached for another three to five years, Ellezam said. Even though the technology is rapidly maturing, business outcomes are slower to manifest due to challenges related to ideation and prioritization, organizational structure, employee skills, and risk management. “There’s huge potential, but it’s a bit of work to mobilize it,” Ellezam said.</p>",

This collaboration sets the stage for the formal launch of ADEPT (Alliance for Data, Evaluation, and Policy Training) later this year, which will empower individuals and organisations worldwide to innovate, test and scale poverty-fighting policies and programmes. </p><p id=\"\">“ADEPT represents a new vision to scale our capacity building work beyond the limits of what we can achieve alone, creating a global ecosystem of evidence-informed policymaking that will help transform how decisions are made and improve countless lives,\" said <a href=\"/people/esther-duflo\" id=\"\">Esther Duflo</a>, co-founder and co-director of J-PAL, about the initiative.<br><br><a href=\"/team/george-richards\" id=\"\">George Richards</a>, director of Community Jameel, said: “ADEPT is a powerful new way for J-PAL to massively scale up its support for the worldwide movement of researchers and practitioners working to alleviate poverty through scientific evidence. With the need to expand this work as great as ever—in the face of climate change, conflict and other challenges—Community Jameel is supporting J-PAL to launch ADEPT later this year, and we are excited to see the ground laid for an ADEPT programme in Côte d’Ivoire.” </p>",

    "excerpt": "<p id=\"\">As a science, economics has never been more widely read and discussed, occasionally even turning into a pop culture phenomenon. Economists like Thomas Piketty, author of the much-discussed and little-read Capital in the 21st Century, and Yannis Varoufakis, Greece’s former finance minister, are the high-brow equivalents of football superstars, filling amphitheatres with young students hungry for alternatives to runaway capitalism. At the same time, the discipline has never faced more uncertainty and criticism, even from within its own ranks. Following the Brexit referendum, Andy Haldane, then Chief Economist of the Bank of England, acknowledged that the profession faces a crisis, as economists are increasingly blamed for society’s ills, while failing to account for human irrationality. A 2019 YouGov survey for Bristol University found that economists were among the ‘least trusted professionals’ in the UK.</p><p id=\"\">One reason for the discipline’s unpopularity is its complexity. “Economists have made a point of turning economics into a closed profession with a lot of jargon. People think that economics is beyond their understanding,” says Paola Subacchi, who teaches international economics at Queen Mary University of London. Despite being a social science, economics relies on advanced mathematics to describe a complex phenomenon like the economy. A recent survey of 350 Bachelor’s degrees by the International Student Initiative for Pluralism in Economics, a group including over 100 universities worldwide, found that economics degrees were highly mathematical, with non-mathematical subjects covered by just 2.5 percent of modules, while real-world applications and history were largely ignored. “The way economics is taught in universities does not include half the tools and concepts necessary to understand economic problems. The core of economics teaching is mathematics, statistics, macroeconomics and microeconomics, meaning that there is no pluralism in terms of theories and disciplines,” says Arthur Jatteau, the University of Lille economist who led the project.</p><p></p>",

These are individuals who were uninsured (9%), had gaps in coverage (11%) or were insured all year but had coverage that did not provide them affordable access to health care (23%). This means that many people who technically have health insurance still have to bear high out-of-pocket costs, including the cost of prescription drugs.

The uncertainty of a health care system in which unregulated coverage is so widespread means that many people have the proverbial sword of Damocles hanging over their heads. About one in five American families has medical debt, meaning they were unable to pay the medical bills when they received care. Among households with medical debt, the average amount owed is approximately $2,000. Households without adequate insurance have nearly twice as much medical debt as households with coverage.

The programme included a high-level panel in the COP28 Green Zone, participation by Lab Co-Director Christopher Bailey in the COP28 Blue Zone, a youth-focused live dialogue at the Jameel Arts Centre, and a private reception hosted by Community Jameel and the WHO Foundation to recognise the Jameel Arts &amp; Health Lab’s work on arts, health and climate. </p><p id=\"\">At the reception, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of WHO said: “The arts can be a powerful ally in our quest to improve health for all. I have seen the impact of the arts on community well-being, and I’m very pleased that this collaboration (with the Jameel Arts &amp; Health Lab) will help us understand the science of that impact in order to improve the lives of people from all backgrounds.” The Lab’s programme at COP28 represented the culmination of a three-month series of ‘listening sessions’ on the theme of arts, health and climate, which began with a roundtable at the Lincoln Center in New York City during UNGA Healing Arts Week, and included participation in MENA Climate Week and a panel within AEON Collective’s tree library as part of Healing Arts Arabia Week in Riyadh. On December 1, a live recording session of the Community Jameel x Afikra Conversation Series for COP28, which amplified the voices of those working at the intersection of the arts, health and climate action, was made available.</p><p id=\"\">The panel discussion explored the impact of the arts on human and planetary health and the role of art in translating science into stories that shape values and shift behaviours. The event was moderated by Clea Daridan, curator at Community Jameel, and Mikey Muhanna, founder and executive director of Afikra. The panelists were Stephen Stapleton, CEO of CULTURUNNERS and co-founder of the Jameel Arts &amp; Health Lab; Dr. Nisha Sajnani, Associate Professor at the Steinhardt School of Culture Education and Human Development, New York University and Co-director of the Jameel Arts &amp; Health Lab; Nadia Christidi, PhD candidate at MIT, researcher, writer and arts practitioner; Uns Kattan, deputy director, Head of Learning and Research, Art Jameel and Dr. Marina Romanello, executive director of Lancet Countdown. “We need to leverage available evidence on the health benefits of engaging in the arts to address the health impacts of climate change,” said Dr. Sajnani.</p><p id=\"\"><br></p>",

Over the past few years, physicians in Belgium and Canada have experimented with sending patients on museum visits, as part of ‘social prescribing,’ to improve their wellbeing and mental health.</p><p id=\"\">Another great believer in the integration of art and healing is Christopher Bailey, who trained as a professional actor and is the co-founder of the Healing Arts Initiative at the World Health Organization.  </p><p id=\"\">“A deep aesthetic experience has an analgesic effect,” Bailey, who is based in Geneva, told Arab News. “It lowers pain, cortisol levels, and your stress goes down. It puts you into a more healing state. There are some very specific examples of a physical or medical effect. In the case of sickle cell anemia in Africa, for example, the malformed blood cells of this genetic disorder clump up like a blood dam in the joints, which causes very painful swelling. So, when you are listening to music that deeply affects you, the dopamine of that aesthetic experience actually dilates the blood vessels, relieving the pain and the swelling. </p><p></p>",

    "excerpt": "<p id=\"\">We often define health by a lack of disease. But drawing from his expansive career across arts and sciences, Christopher Bailey says, “To trace its etymology, the word health itself comes from an Anglo-Saxon root, which is a cognate to the word whole. Health is not about the absence of a weakness, but rather about being a complete person.” Now serving as the Arts and Health Lead at the World Health Organization, he creates and shares global initiatives for health and healing. His work, informed by his own experience of losing his sight, also inspires us to broaden our understandings of beauty and perception. Challenging the tendency to over-medicalize health, he says, “It's a positive asset. It's not the lack of a deficit.” And the arts, as you’ll read here, can help us reach that highest quality of being human and alive.</p><p id=\"\"><strong>What was your journey to become a leading advocate for arts in health? </strong></p><p id=\"\">It’s funny looking back on it. If you were to describe my current work to me at any point in my life's journey, I would've laughed and said, no, that's not the plan. But fate had other ideas. As Nietzsche once said with his term amor fati, part of maturing is falling in love with your fate and saying, you know what? I didn't know I was going to be here. But every step of it made sense. Every step of it was leading me to this moment.</p><p id=\"\">Throughout my life, I've toggled back and forth between the arts and the sciences. When I started getting too comfortable in one, I would begin to yearn for the other. When I was a professional actor in my twenties, I did a lot of interesting work, but I also did work that was not particularly compelling. And I just thought, what am I doing with my life? Similarly, when I would get more involved in the sciences, there were times when I felt I wasn’t doing anything for my soul. Unconsciously, I began to lean towards combinations of arts and health to navigate those two interests.</p>",

What's important about that definition from an arts context is oftentimes, people over-medicalise the arts and start focusing on measures that are based on deficits, the reduction of disease or symptoms. But the real power of the arts is the opposite: the true definition of health. It's raising your physical wellbeing to its highest degree, your mental wellbeing to its highest degree, your social wellbeing to its highest degree. It's a positive asset. It's not the lack of a deficit.\"</p><p id=\"\">He adds, \"Through the Jameel Arts &amp; Health Lab, we’ve created a consortium of research centres around the world that are filling out the evidence base, developing robust studies to not only look at arts-based health interventions at the clinical or community level, but also at the fundamental bioscience and neuroscience foundational level.

Cette synthèse démontre qu’il n’y a aucun bénéfice à regrouper les élèves de façon permanente, comme c’est le cas avec les classes de niveau ou le redoublement. En revanche, les données probantes existantes suggèrent que les regroupements flexibles et transitoires, comme les groupes de besoin au sein de la classe, produisent des résultats plus encourageants. La flexibilité permet de réduire la stigmatisation induite par la constitution de groupes permanents, car une organisation trop rigide risque de renforcer la vision fixiste de l’intelligence que peuvent avoir les élèves, et qui peut être entretenue par les attentes des enseignants.</p>",

    "excerpt": "<p id=\"\">In Bernard Shaw’s <em id=\"\">Man and Superman</em>, Don Giovanni finds himself in hell, chatting to the sentient Statue that dragged him to his doom. ‘It sounds rather flat without my trombones,’ admits the Statue, conceding that once you remove the genius of Mozart from the mix, you’re left with a trite (if titillating) morality tale. You could draw the same conclusion from the opera <em id=\"\">Don Giovanni Tenorio</em>, by Giuseppe Gazzaniga (1743-1818), and if you haven’t heard of him you might wonder why not. Institutional racism? Patriarchal hegemony? Not this time. Gazzaniga was a Neapolitan composer of perfectly adequate operas that simply aren’t as good as Mozart’s.</p><p id=\"\">Anyway, <em id=\"\">Don Giovanni Tenorio</em> made an amusing end-of-term show at the Royal College of Music. Who wouldn’t be intrigued by a <em id=\"\">Don Giovanni</em> premiered in 1787, eight months before Mozart’s? The fun lies in comparing and contrasting the two. How will Gazzaniga deal with Donna Elvira? When will the Commendatore arrive? Here’s the Catalogue Aria – funny, it sounds just like Mozart’s. Hang on, it actually is Mozart’s! Possibly to enhance the experience for the student cast, director Louise Bakker decided to insert a series of arias by Salieri and Mozart into Gazzaniga’s score. <br></p>",

The first is a panel hosted by AEON Collective entitled “Safeguarding Our Planet: Biodiversity, Climate, and One Health”. Her Royal Highness will be discussing the importance of conservation efforts as not just an environmental priority but a cornerstone for sustainable development, economic stability, and social well-being. This event will be taking place in the blue zone (an area of the conference reserved for only accredited organizations and sanctioned by the United Nations) at the Saudi Pavilion. Next, Her Royal Highness will be participating on a panel hosted by the International Coral Reef Initiative, The Global Fund for Coral Reefs, UN Environment and Development Programs, Race to Resilience, and the UN Capital Development Fund. The focus of this event will be around the newly launched “Coral Reef Breakthrough” initiative that has developed a call to action to prevent further coral reef habitat loss, the doubling of coral reef habitat reefs under effective protection, accelerate restoration, and secure investments to fund coral reef conservation. This event will also be hosted in the blue zone at the UNEP pavilion. And lastly, her Royal Highness will speak at the CORDAP hosted (Coral Research &amp; Development Accelerator Platform) event “From Pledges to Action for Corals”. Princess Hala will be discussing the key points behind the Foundation’s success in helping facilitate international collaboration and cooperation for coral reef conservation.

The first Arab woman to receive the prestigious Bocelli-Jameel scholarship at the Royal College of Music, Mekhail’s journey has been an inspirational one. “I’m from a small city called Minia; my father is a doctor, and my mother is an engineer. To opt for an unconventional career like classical singing was uncommon,” says Mekhail. But she was adamant and sought a scholarship for singing abroad despite the “what are you going to do with this degree” questions. The soprano has had a passion for singing since she was a little girl and recalls getting a standing ovation at her church choir as a soloist during an Easter service. That very moment is when she decided to become a classical singer. “It’s an honor to be the first Arab to receive the Bocelli-Jameel scholarship. But it comes with a responsibility – many young classical singers look up to me and ask me questions about how I got there. I must always improve in what I do as an opera singer.” Next, she will perform a recital at Dubai Opera for her first title role as Jane Eyre with the Green Opera Company in London.</p>",

The Scottish tenor Marcus Swietlicki was light-voiced and suave in the title role, his fellow Scot, baritone Daniel Barrett, comical as his sidekick, Pasquariello. There was no weak link. Louise Bakker’s staging (with designs by Becky-Dee Trevenen, lighting by Joshua Gadsby) was traditional – wigs and frock coats – but deft. The orchestra, under the experienced baton of the RCM’s director of opera, Michael Rosewell, negotiated the many rapid scurries and string flourishes with stylish accuracy.</p><p>This take on the story, still shot through with menace, is more lighthearted than Mozart’s. The predominantly sunny disposition is partly explained by much of the music being in the major key (Mozart set the tone, from the opening chords, in the minor). In the habit of Italian opera at that time, music from elsewhere has been added: from Mozart himself (Leporello’s “Catalogue” aria) and by Antonio Salieri. The full cast deserves praise, especially those responsible for the angry duet: Australian soprano Georgia Melville (Donna Elvira) and as Maturina, her rival in love, South Korean soprano Henna Mun. Having put so much work into learning this unfamiliar music, let’s hope they all get a chance to perform it again in their careers.</p>",

It can do all these things with the same basic building block—polymers, which are hefty strings of molecules. Whether a polymer becomes a rigid suitcase or a thin sheet of Saran wrap depends on the type of polymer, the chemicals that are added, and the way it’s cooked up into the final product.</p><p id=\"\">This diversity is what makes plastic so cool and versatile and <em id=\"\">successful</em>. But that success is one of the reasons we’re now facing a massive plastic pollution crisis. We rely so heavily on plastic that the current amount on the planet weighs more than all land and sea animals put together. Microplastics have been found in human blood and breastmilk, Antarctic snow, and rain. Of the thousands of chemicals added to plastics, about one-third of them remain poorly understood. And the wide range of components in plastic—the diversity that makes it such a useful material—is also what makes it really hard to recycle, contributing to the plastic pollution crisis we’re in today, says Costas Velis, an international expert on the circular economy of plastic.<br></p><p id=\"\">The plastic problem has gotten so bad that last year more than 170 countries came together to discuss writing a treaty like the Paris climate accords but for plastic. Many experts say that the treaty needs to focus on reducing plastic production. But while this is an important goal, the idea that we’ll just stop needing plastic is “total wishful thinking,” says Velis. “Historically, we’re just producing more and more plastic, because it’s affordable and because it gave us functionalities that we didn’t have.” In fact, plastic production is on track to almost <em id=\"\">triple</em> by 2060. And the treaty is facing a “coordinated campaign” by the petrochemical industry to slow progress, as seen during the latest negotiations in Nairobi, Kenya, earlier this month.</p><p></p>",

The Royal College of Music has made an enterprising attempt to change this by staging for their Autumn production <a href=\"https://bachtrack.com/composer/gazzaniga-giuseppe\" id=\"\">Giuseppe Gazzaniga’s</a><em id=\"\">Don Giovanni, o sia Il convitato di pietra</em> (sometimes known as <em id=\"\">Don Giovanni tenorio</em>).</p><p id=\"\">A representative of the Neapolitan School, Gazzaniga is little known by modern audiences. His <em id=\"\">Don Giovanni</em> is one of over fifty operas written across a half a century; it premiered in early 1787, a few months before Mozart and Da Ponte’s adaptation delighted Prague. Alas, a comparison of the two goes decidedly against Gazzaniga, and the RCM’s production – as well performed as it is – serves only to remind one of Mozart’s unique genius and Da Ponte’s dramatic flair. Nowhere was this more obvious than in the insertion of Mozart’s Catalogue Aria, brought in to this production as gesture of historicity on the grounds that operatic performances of the time would often feature arias from other composers; several by Salieri also appeared in this production. </p><p id=\"\">There are points of departure: instead of Mozart’s three women – Donnas Anna and Elvira, and Zerlina – we have Anna, Elvira and Donna Ximena, while Maturina replaces Zerlina. There’s an entertaining scene in which Don Giovanni is balancing Ximena with Elvira, only to have Maturina enter for an amusing verbal battle with Elvira, a moment of <em id=\"\">buffa</em> outstandingly delivered by the cast which put me in mind of the confrontation between Susanna and Marcellina in <em id=\"\">Figaro</em>. The opera otherwise largely follows the same lines as Mozart’s, albeit in one-act form.</p>",

During his first four years at the Institute, he was a critical member of the Solar Electric Vehicle Team (SEVT) and eventually led the group to victory in a five-day, 900-mile race. Later, he translated the skills he learned from SEVT to a summer internship in Ghana with the [MIT D-Lab spinout] &nbsp;Moving Health, where he worked on low-cost ambulances that could transport patients from remote villages to medical care, without relying on gasoline.

For the former, he has taken the helm of the MIT Electric Vehicle Team, a student-led research team that is probing the future of transportation by designing a hydrogen-powered motorcycle. And for his master’s thesis research, Mehrotra is building a new mechatronics curriculum, an interdisciplinary course at the intersection of mechanical and electrical engineering.</p><p id=\"\">Mehrotra cannot remember a time in his life when science did not consume his attention.

To improve existing risk prediction models, Drs. Barzilay, Yala, and their colleagues have developed a mammography-based deep learning model called MIRAI. This model was designed to predict an individual’s risk of developing breast cancer by analyzing multiple mammography timepoints and leveraging potentially missing risk factor information. In addition, MIRAI has the potential to produce breast cancer risk predictions that are consistent across mammography machines. Developing MIRAI involved utilizing a large dataset of mammographic information from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). It was tested across diverse patient data accumulated from seven hospitals in the United States and other countries. In this retrospective testing, the model was able to reliably identify high-risk patients, outperforming existing methods by a large margin. The goal of the current study is to test MIRAI in a prospective study, where patients predicted to be high-risk by this model are followed by MRI screening to assess its accuracy.</p><p></p>",

A woman’s work in the family contributes to the well-being of humans in society: it does not add to the growth of the economy and GDP. Ms. Goldin’s research reveals that women, who also attend to the caring work required for families at home, are considered less valuable in economic enterprises because they cannot commit to continuously working full time for their employers, which men can.<a href=\"https://archive.ph/o/k7cdD/https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/women-marriage-and-labour-market-participation/article67459057.ece\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\"><br></a></p><p></p>",

Through a range of presentations, meals, debates and workshops the international gathering explores cultural and artistic tactics to operate in the space of food policy. The Assembly brings together farmers, artists, chefs, growers, cooperatives, hospitality businesses, researchers, cultural thinkers, environmentalists, civic leaders, seed keepers and policy-makers to reimagine the role museums and cultural institutions have as agents of transformation within the climate crisis. It takes place at Museo delle Civiltà and Campidoglio—the seat of Rome City Council. Key speakers include: Sepake Angiama, Casa delle Agriculture, Cooperativa Karadrà, Tommaso Fattori, Anne Immonen, Instroom Academy, Parviz Koohafkan, Frances Morris, Qanat Collective, Sakiya, and SERIT Seeds.</p><p id=\"\">For more than a century industrial agriculture has created intensive systems reliant on agrochemicals to boost yields at any cost, claiming to feed the world’s population while disrupting ancestral ways of living within and above the ground. A metabolic rift has separated the soil from what it means to culture it, to grow food, to nourish the ground and human bodies. The CLIMAVORE Assembly addresses the broken food system created by intensive agriculture and the globalised supply chain, asking how to reconnect appetite with fields; and metabolism with the underground. </p><p id=\"\">Climate struggles cannot be separated from cultural shifts, and cultural shifts require new forms of action. Initiated by Cooking Sections in 2015, CLIMAVORE is a research platform that questions how to eat as humans change the climate. As seasons creep, we recognise that eating less industrial meat protein, more locally grown produce or plant-based dishes is crucial—but perhaps not enough. CLIMAVORE moves beyond a carnivore, omnivore, locavore, vegetarian or vegan diet into a way of eating according to a season of drought, polluted seas or infertile soil. </p><p></p>",

Many expensive patches have produced more problems than they have fixed. Since health care accounts for just under one-fifth of the country’s GDP, this is a mountainous claim. The authors are not principally concerned with the plight of the 27 million or so uninsured Americans but rather the other 90 percent of Americans who do have health insurance but are underinsured, drowning in medical debt, or tied by their insurance to jobs they want to leave. In this system, both the sick and the healthy spend endless unproductive hours navigating the tortuous and often cruel maze of insurance bureaucracy. On a broader level, the U.S. health-care system operates without a budget and spends 50 to 100 percent more per capita than many European and Asian systems that produce better outcomes (including lower infant mortality, less time spent in the hospital, shorter wait times, and so on). In an eminently readable account, the authors argue for a wholly new approach consisting of genuinely universal, free, basic care overlaid with the option to buy fancier supplemental care: to provide, in short, adequate treatment for all if not complete equality.</p>",

Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, nearly every strategic move Rostow advocated turned out to be wrong, from escalating the commitment of U.S. combat troops for South Vietnam to rejecting peace talks with the North Vietnamese. Since he continued to defend those positions after most other people had concluded they were mistakes, his name became a byword for a specific kind of Washington virtue: offering terrible advice but at least doing so consistently. “[Zbigniew] Brzezinski aspires to be the Henry Kissinger of this administration,” the historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., noted in his diary in May 1978 as the administration of President Jimmy Carter was developing a harder line toward the Soviet Union. “I fear he will end up the Walt Rostow.”</p>",

Add to the mix a young viola player already in the top league, Timothy Ridout, and a programme featuring music by an individual voice among composers, Rebecca Clarke, and there was reason enough to travel to Oxford yesterday.</p><p id=\"\">Hopes were movingly rewarded.

What a polymath he was, how originally he applied his knowledge and how reassuring that he made his individual way in Oxford, which used to be less alll-embracing, at least in the 1980s when my bid to do a phD there, with willing supervisors in various departments, was rejected on the grounds that \"we are not an interdisciplinary university\".<br></p>",

But pretrained VPD models can show a dip in performance due to overfitting when they are self-supervised. Recently, researchers from Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed an adversarial task adaptive pretraining approach, which enhances the performance of a VPD model by over 15%, compared to the state-of-the-art ResNet50 model.</p><p id=\"\">Voice pathology refers to a problem arising from abnormal conditions, such as dysphonia, paralysis, cysts, and even cancer, that cause abnormal vibrations in the vocal cords (or vocal folds). In this context, voice pathology detection (VPD) has received much attention as a non-invasive way to automatically detect voice problems. It consists of two processing modules: a feature extraction module to characterize normal voices and a voice detection module to detect abnormal ones. Machine learning methods like support vector machines (SVM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been successfully utilized as pathological voice detection modules to achieve good VPD performance. Also, a self-supervised, pretrained model can learn generic and rich speech feature representation, instead of explicit speech features, which further improves its VPD abilities. However, fine-tuning these models for VPD leads to an overfitting problem, due to a domain shift from conversation speech to the VPD task. As a result, the pretrained model becomes too focused on the training data and does not perform well on new data, preventing generalization.</p><p id=\"\">To mitigate this problem, a team of researchers from Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) in South Korea, led by Prof. Hong Kook Kim, has proposed a groundbreaking contrastive learning method involving Wave2Vec 2.0 — a self-supervised pretrained model for speech signals — with a novel approach called adversarial task adaptive pretraining (A-TAPT).

The planet faces a “rapidly narrowing window” to avert catastrophic levels of warming. Even if countries fulfill existing pledges, the Earth is projected to warm by 2.4 degrees Celsius by the turn of the century — a <a href=\"https://archive.ph/o/dW7MY/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/18/climate-crisis-heat-is-on-global-heating-four-degrees-2100-change-way-we-live\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">smaller increase than was projected</a> a few years ago but still well past the 1.5-degree threshold scientists say the globe shouldn’t cross.</p><p id=\"\">In the lead-up to the annual U.N. climate conference (COP28) starting next month, this forecast should put policymakers and business leaders on notice.

    "excerpt": "<p>My great-great-grandfather is one of the figures that most families probably have (or need to invent), whose impractical ways lost us our one chance of being really rich. My favourite from the many stories my grandfather told us about him is the one where he was bathing in the local pond when someone brought news that his stepbrother’s family just had a son. He was about to head over there in his wet dhoti (this was before Speedo) when the messenger reminded him that he hadn’t got his reward. He apparently hesitated for a few seconds, then just took off the dhoti and went off to congratulate the lucky family. In the buff.</p><p>I often think of this story from the point of view of the recipient. Was he happy with the wet and probably much-used dhoti? Would he have preferred to wait and get some money, say? Or was he delighted by the flourish of that gesture, or slightly embarrassed by it, or both?</p><p>This gets to the heart of the economics of gift-giving: why do we take the trouble to give gifts? Why not just send the equivalent amount by UPI? Tagore, perceptive as always, framed this issue beautifully in a poem that we read as kids. It was puja season, as it will be soon, and two brothers were pestering their mom to see their puja clothes. When she does, one gets very upset — he was expecting something nicer — but as she explains, they just didn’t have the money. The other, perhaps in reaction, says he loves the gift. The upset child runs off to the local magnate’s house, which was being readied for the pujo. People were milling around, some no doubt were making themselves useful, others, I suspect, in the quite reasonable expectation that this being Bengal, there would be some mishti (sweets) soon. In my imagination, someone comes around with a large thali of chanaboras, dark and glistening with ghee and syrup.</p>",

Abhijit provides anecdotal family memories, a poignant message from a popular poem about <em id=\"\">puja</em> and a case from a Yale professor of economics to examine the social constructs of gift-giving. </p><p id=\"\">In the piece, Abhijit writes, 'We give gifts to signal that we care, that we thought of the person, of what she would like and the way her face would light up when she realises that someone had thought hard about her preferences. Economists recognise that sending the right signal is important, say when you want a job or have something to sell. But when we think of how we build and maintain our social connections, our instinct is to think about personal likes and dislikes, rather than as a central strategic element of our economic lives, as it would be for an anthropologist. Hence, the focus is on the happiness from possessing the gifted object, rather than on what the act of gifting does to our relationship.'</p><p id=\"\">As a gift to readers, Abhijit shares his family recipe for <a href=\"/recipes/abhijits-sheera\"><em id=\"\">sheera</em></a><em id=\"\">. </em></p>",

For this survey we are leaving the BRUVs for one hour. The BRUVs have underwater lights and two Go Pro 9 cameras in underwater cases that record life on or near the seabed. A bait box helps to lure any mobile marine life in the vicinity towards the cameras. The bait box is filled with fish (we have gone for herring, but you can use other bait). Marine life are lured to the cameras by the smell of the fish. After an hour, the BRUVs are recovered and brought back to the boat, the video footage is downloaded and the scientists on board can check out what marine life has come to investigate the bait.</p>"

She demonstrates that patient trust is an important driver of the demand for healthcare, highlighting data that suggests that fewer than 50% of cases are correctly managed, and 70-90% of expenditures are medically unnecessary due to incorrect treatment from healthcare providers. Her study also finds that a publicised training programme significantly raises quality of care among providers without changing their medical knowledge. This research reveals the powerful effects of low trust between healthcare providers and their patients, providing valuable insights for policymakers.</p>",

    "excerpt": "<p id=\"\">Wetlands, swamps, bogs, and marshes are all incredibly rich habitats. For centuries they have been drained to ‘improve’ land for farming and real estate, displace people avoiding state control, or eradicate mosquito-borne diseases within settler–colonial regimes. In 2023/24, ADS3 will look at the legacies of desiccated land that are struggling to fluctuate between wet and dry. Situated at the frontier of mineral and financial extraction, these murky post–industrial landscapes are increasingly emerging out of the ruins of capitalism. Some are reflooded in an attempt to be returned to an impossible past state, while others materialise out of abandoned quarries and mining pits. These emergent ecologies become habitats for new anthropogenic environments. Whether ‘natural’ or newly formed, post–industrial wetlands can offer new models of inhabitation through soil and water nourishment across human and non-human populations. Guided by these swampy formations, the studio will question ways in which the built environment can forge new alliances to rethink the redundant infrastructures of modernity. How can we think through wetlands to design support structures for spatial justice? Through the lens of CLIMAVORE – a framework that explores how to eat in the era of human–driven climate change – ADS3 will use architectural tools to map ecological and legal struggles in landscapes trying to stay afloat and in place.</p><p id=\"\">Like many other ecosystems, wetlands have been transformed by human actions and extractivist processes from the Industrial Revolution onward. This transformation has only accelerated since the second world war. As a result, seasons have shifted at unexpected rates, altering the food production and harvests that follow them. Prolonged dry spells during the rainy season in Ghana and Ivory Coast are threatening cocoa supply in the world’s top producing countries. 2021 marked the earliest cherry blossoms in China, where spring and summer are believed to arrive 3.3 days and 4.6 days earlier per decade respectively. Rice farmers, who grow their crops in wetlands, are shifting their planting calendars as both drought and extreme rainfall reduce rice yields. In Europe, the first day of spring has advanced by six to eight days in the past 30 years. Wine harvesting in Burgundy, France, now starts in mid-August, almost a full month earlier than only a few decades ago. Signs that formerly allowed humans to organise life around seasons have become indicators of an imminent crisis. They expose new waves of ‘global weirding’ or ‘season creep’. A vicious loop makes the idea of seasons even more superfluous. The more industries extend seasonality, the more seasons shift, and as seasons shift more, the more industries seek damaging technological solutions to fix a global food system on the brink of collapse.</p><p>Under such emerging seasonalities, how can the built environment respond to the ongoing crisis that confronts those inhabiting them? CLIMAVORE is a research framework that explores how to eat as humans change climates. New human-made ‘seasons’ are affecting temperature and precipitation, blurring the lines between spring, summer, autumn, and winter, together with yearly monsoon events. Instead, periods of polluted seas, soil exhaustion, or fertiliser runoff are more influential on our foodscapes. CLIMAVORE advocates that new multispecies approaches to food landscapes, such as wetlands, can highlight the cultural and ecological value of species and spaces that are being pushed to extinction. ADS3 questions how we can secure and enhance ecologies in flux through the commoning of land and expanding food belts, which support agroecological practices. As the global aridity lines move towards the Poles, how can certain ingredients guide policy making and legal efforts to make sure wetland inhabitants stay empowered? How can their environments be kept wet and murky?</p>",

Esther's approach to addressing social and economic development through randomised evaluations and evidence-based policy design, has resulted in governments around the world adopting the methodology. In a wide-ranging interview with <a href=\"/sources/le-temps\" id=\"\">Le Temps</a>, Esther speaks on deconstructing stereotypes about the poor, resource management, the value of evidence-based policy and her children's book series, illustrated by Cheyenne Olivier and published by Seuil jeunesse. </p><p id=\"\">On poverty in Europe, Esther states: \"In the same way as in developing countries, poverty has many facets and is accompanied by a series of health problems, particularly mental ones, in the countries of the North – it is not just a question of money. All these problems combine in the same way in rich countries. A preconceived idea that we were able to deconstruct is that social assistance makes people lazy. This is not the case, and this has been demonstrated repeatedly, including for poor countries.\"</p><p id=\"\">On the role of evaluations in informing government policy, she says: \"Evaluations have their place in the government arsenal, to learn what works and what doesn't, what needs to be generalised, what needs to be stopped. We don't need to evaluate all public policies all the time. But it is effective to know what can be done and done well, and sometimes it is less costly to estimate the cost of a program before rolling it out. The amounts wasted are worse when we develop projects whose effectiveness has not been tested.\"</p>",

It can only be addressed through a whole new wave of innovations, in virtually every sector including farming. PAA will bring global and regional philanthropies together to work with governments, businesses, and other stakeholders to catalyse and scale up these innovations.'</p>",

'Considering biased data as informative artifacts in AI-assisted health care' was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

In both cases the information is perhaps not entirely accurate or favourable: Maybe we think that we behave in certain ways as a society — but when you actually look at the data, it tells a different story. We might not like what that story is, but once you unearth an understanding of the past you can move forward and take steps to address poor practices,\" she says.</p><p id=\"\">While the paper's authors propose that there is much to be learned from biased data sets, they note that fixing biased algorithms and generating better and more robust data remains essential to the progress of AI-assisted healthcare.</p><p id=\"\">Marzyeh speaks about the National Institutes of Health (NIH)'s approach, saying the agency has “prioritised data collection in ethical ways that cover information we have not previously emphasised the value of in human health — such as environmental factors and social determinants.

If we take a narrow technical view of the data we extract from systems, we could naively replicate poor practices. That’s not the only option — realising there is a problem is our first step towards a larger opportunity.\"</p>",

The models determined whether or not a dress code violation had occurred based on interpreting descriptions of the dress code vs interpreting violations based on past human judgement of what constitutes a violation. The study found that when models are trained to determine a rule violation based on a set of descriptive indicators, more violations are registered. When models learn based on human interpretation of data, human flexibility becomes part of the model's learning. With data labeling based on descriptive indicators, there is no ambiguity. </p><p id=\"\">“This is an important warning for a field where datasets are often used without close examination of labeling practices, and [it] underscores the need for caution in automated decision systems—particularly in contexts where compliance with societal rules is essential,” says Marzyeh.</p><p id=\"\">Decision-making algorithms are already present in our everyday lives. Algorithms determine what appears on our news and entertainment feeds and how tasks are assigned to gig workers. They also make decisions about who will get hired for a job or admitted to a college from a pool of candidates, how bail is set, and which patients receive priority medical care. As the decision-making algorithms become ever more embedded into our daily lives, and with significant consequences attached to those decisions, data labeling joins a mounting list of ethical questions around model training, bias, and perpetuation of practices that contribute to inequality.</p>",

She frets about what she’s wearing, looks on enviously at the other women, and wonders whether she will ever be admired like the muses in the surrounding artworks. Laura, who recently completed her diploma at the Royal College of Music as a Bocelli-Jameel Scholar, guides the audience through a rollercoaster of emotions and thoughts: from self-doubt to awkwardness, punctuated with flashes of humour. 'She sings with an attractively bright tone', matching Rose’s excitement, and she’s capable of effortless power'. She also harnesses the nostalgia in the 'Lucky child' aria, where Rose fondly remembers the warmth of her loving family life growing up.<br><br>In 'La Voix', soprano Katherine McIndoe is 'a deeply absorbing 'Elle', less hysterical and psychodramatic than some, but alert to everything said by her lover over the phone, a side of the conversation that the audience never hears'. The role presents a huge challenge in rendering the speech patterns of the text, while maintaining tonal interest, something Katherine achieves to great effect. Her tone is both 'lucid and absorbingly rich' in this distinguished interpretation, which future performances will render 'utterly commanding'.<br><br>Photo: Nick Rutter</p>",

    "summary": "<p id=\"\">How artificial intelligence (AI) will impact different industries and the labour market at large has been a prime arena for debate and speculation since the uptake and accelerated application of AI took effect in everyday and work settings. In this opinion article, experts in the field share various perspective on the extent to which AI technology has the potential to cause widespread disruption or bring major benefits to existing forms of work.<br><br>Examples of where AI can help workforces include reducing the administrative burden on clinicians and allowing them to focus more on improving the patient experience and welfare. Similarly, AI-powered diagnostic and treatment tools, such as those developed by <a href=\"/people/regina-barzilay\" id=\"\">Regina Barzilay</a> at the <a href=\"/programme/jameel-clinic\">MIT Jameel Clinic</a>, can shift late-disease treatment to prevention and early-stage interventions. Key AI-powered tools designed by Regina include <a href=\"/innovations/sybil\" id=\"\">Sybil</a>, a diagnostic tool that can detect lung cancer risk in patients up to six years in advance, and <a href=\"/innovations/mirai\" id=\"\">Mirai</a>, also an AI-trained tool which can screen accurately for breast cancer risk, aiding early detection.</p><p id=\"\">Though experts recognise that issues and hurdles remain as to the safe and steady roll out of AI, especially in medical settings, they ultimately conclude that the technology has a greater potential to assist in tasks and provide an additional layer of support to help many humans work better and faster, as opposed to taking away jobs. Researchers argue it is important to consider not only the risks of AI, but also the potential benefits and opportunities it presents.<br></p>",

Wealth is moving from the merely rich (the famous 1%) to the super-duper-rich, the kind of people who find it worthwhile to use tax havens and complicated strategies to dodge billions in taxes (think of Apply moving its intellectual property to Ireland to avoid paying the higher US taxes).</p><p id=\"\">\"All of this might be less worrying if this accumulating wealth was being used for the social good. Reliable numbers are scarce, but a valiant attempt by the Global Philanthropy Tracker at the University of Indiana puts the total cross-border philanthropy in 2020 at USD 70 billion. Not all of that money goes to poor countries. Or is aimed at alleviating poverty - quite a bit goes to churches, mosques and temples, for one. Let us, in the absence of numbers, very optimistically assume that USD 35 billion went to the world's poor. This is less than USD 2 out of every extra USD 1,000 wealth that the world's richest 1% accumulated every year between 2020 and 2023. Of course, there are other ways to serve the poorest - for example, investments that create jobs or inventions that slow global warming - but the poor still need education and healthcare and help when they cannot support themselves economically. Just the Government of India spends something like USD 220 billion on that annually, seven times our estimate of global private generosity. Governments around the world fund a vast majority of the day-to-day fight against global poverty.\"</p>",

One such contributing study was conducted by <a href=\"/people/daisy-fancourt\" id=\"\">Daisy Fancourt</a>, University College London and steering committee chair, Jameel Arts &amp; Health Lab; and fellow researcher Rosie Perkins, Royal College of Music. The study involved a sample of 134 mothers suffering from postpartum depression, split into three groups to receive different interventions over a ten-week period. One group received standard care, which included family support, medication and psychotherapy, another group engaged in activity-based play, while the remaining group took part in singing workshops. The group that engaged in singing showed the fastest improvement in mental wellbeing. Symptoms of depression in the singing group decreased by 35% in six weeks.</p>",

The USD&nbsp;400 million project was backed by the United Nations and was launched by former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton in 2010. It set out to reduce indoor air pollution, which kills two million people a year, while empowering women and helping the environment. After initial success, millions of stoves built in India were largely abandoned within four years. Abhijit and Esther studied the reasons for the failure and told the world why such an altruistic and even rational project flopped.

    "summary": "<p id=\"\">During the COVID-19 pandemic, women—particularly in the Global South—became increasingly exposed to gender-based violence (GBV) and intimate partner violence, due to restrictions on movement, social isolation and economic stress. Given social distancing, women without knowledge of GBV resources were especially vulnerable and less able to access in-person support, highlighting the need for GBV organisations to find alternative ways to connect with them. In particular, <a href=\"https://www.povertyactionlab.org/blog/6-15-20/evidence-based-approaches-tackling-recent-increases-gender-based-violence\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">previous research has shown</a> that media and “edutainment” (educational entertainment) campaigns can be successful in reducing violence against women. </p><p id=\"\">Egypt has high levels of gender inequality and gender-based violence, ranking 129th out of 153 countries in the World Economic Forum’s 2020 Global Gender Gap Index. As of 2015, 36% of ever-married women between the ages of 15 and 49 in Egypt reported having experienced physical domestic violence, but only one-third sought help and only 18% reported it. A policy intervention evaluation by the <a href=\"/programme/jameel-poverty-action-lab\" id=\"\">Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action</a> (J-PAL) was conducted in Egypt to evaluate the impact of disseminating content designed to shift norms around gender-based violence and provide support to survivors via Facebook, WhatsApp and television.</p><p id=\"\">Over 5,000 Egyptian women took part in the J-PAL evaluation, which randomly disseminated short videos in which Aboul Qomsan, the founder of the Egypt Centre for Women's Rights (ECWR), addresses patriarchal norms, emphasises that women are not to blame for violence, encourages friends and family to support survivors and discusses ECWR’s resources. Receiving the videos was found to, in a <a href=\"/publications/empowering-women-facing-gender-based-violence-amid-covid-19-through-media-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> published in August 2023 in Nature, increase women's knowledge of resources available to those experiencing gender-based violence, and their hypothetical and actual use of these resources.</p>",

The study was led by the Agricultural Technology Adoption Initiative (ATAI), co-led by J-PAL and the Center for Effective Global Action at University of California, Berkeley (CEGA), and in partnership with Niger's Ministry of Environment.</p><p id=\"\">The study took place in the Sahel region of Sub-Saharan Africa, where nearly 80%&nbsp;of farmland is degraded. Researchers tested the barriers to utilising a rainwater harvesting technique known as demi-lunes, which captures rainwater over a period of two to three days while mitigating soil runoff and improving nutrient availability in the soil. In Niger's Zinder region, small-scale farmers to not make use of the practice, which can improve crop yields. The study sought to determine whether the cost of implementing the technology (around USD 80 per hectare) or lack of technical information prevented the use of demi-lunes. Researchers conducted a randomised evaluation which included a half-day, in-person technical training for the theory and practice of demi-lune construction and application. The study also provided conditional and unconditional cash transfers for the construction of the systems. </p><p id=\"\">The study found that in villages that received the training course, use of demi-lunes increased by 90 percentage points compared to the villages that did not receive the intervention. Meanwhile, the supplementation of either conditional or unconditional cash transfers had limited additional impact on the farmers' use of the technique. The promising results from the evaluation have helped researchers garner funds from J-PAL's King Climate Action Initiative (K-CAI) and USAID-DIV for further evaluation of training content and format and monitoring methods across a larger group of farmers in the Maradi and Zinder regions of eastern Niger. The scale-up will involve introducing an additional rainwater harvesting technique known as zai, testing the impact of remote sensing as a monitoring method as opposed to in-person monitoring, and expanding the training to all agricultural households in the studied villages. The scale-up will cover 400 villages, impacting nearly 6,000 households.</p>",

    "summary": "<p id=\"\">Emerging research implies a mammography-based deep learning (DL) model may aid in identifying precancerous changes in high-risk women. The study, recently published in 'Radiology: Artificial Intelligence', featured a dataset enriched with African American women, BRCA mutation carriers and those with benign breast disease. The researchers utilised <a href=\"/innovation/mirai\">Mirai</a>, a DL model developed by AI faculty lead <a href=\"/people/regina-barzilay\">Regina Barzilay</a> and her colleagues at the MIT <a href=\"/programme/jameel-clinic\" id=\"\">Jameel Clinic</a>. In this experiment, Mirai was trained on nearly 211,000 screening mammograms, to assess 6,266 mammography exams from 2,043 women. Findings demonstrate that the DL model achieved a five-year Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 65% for predicting breast cancer, compared to 54% for the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS). The researchers also note the significant role of imaging the breast with future cancer within the AI model. Mirroring demonstrated a 62% AUC for positive mirroring and a 51% AUC for negative mirroring. This suggests that DL could detect precancerous or early malignant changes before they become apparent. While the research acknowledges limitations, such as a limited sample size for other racial groups beyond Black and White women, the results suggest that DL tools could enhance the assessment of screening mammograms for more accurate near-term risk stratification.</p>",

The app, named Leotenango, operates offline making it accessible to children in areas with limited internet connectivity. The app groups students based on educational level and reading ability, rather than age or grade level, a methodology known as 'Teaching at the right level' (TARL), which was developed by the <a href=\"/programme/jameel-poverty-action-lab\" id=\"\">Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab</a> (J-PAL) and has proven successful in improving reading skills. In addition to determining reading levels and offering lessons, Leotenango provides interactive learning features and gamified content, utilising characters such as Quincy, a quetzal bird (Guatemala's national bird), to guide students through activities. As children progress, they earn badges marking their accomplishments. The app was met with overwhelmingly positive feedback in its alpha phase, and a beta version is set to be tested by around 100 people. The organisation believes that the app will significantly enhance its ability to improve literacy rates in Central America, extending its reach beyond the schools it has built.</p>",

    "summary": "<p id=\"\">This essay by economists Liran Einav and <a href=\"/people/amy-finkelstein\" id=\"\">Amy Finkelstein</a>, who is the co-scientific director of the <a href=\"/programme/jameel-poverty-action-lab\">Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab</a> (J-PAL) North America, argues that the United States is already spending an equivalent amount of taxpayer money on healthcare as other high-income countries, yet American citizens are not receiving the benefits of universal coverage. A number of issues with the current healthcare system persist. For instance, even insured Americans can face the risk of huge medical bills for their covered care and about 11% of Americans under the age of 65 are uninsured in any given month, while many more are constantly at risk of losing their coverage. This reality contradicts the idea that health insurance should provide stability and the authors ague that universal coverage should be automatic, free, and basic. The solution to the United States' health insurance issues may not be as unique as its problem; adopting a model of guaranteed basic coverage, as seen in other high-income countries, could be the answer.</p>",

    "summary": "<p id=\"\">The search to identify proteins that can strongly bind to targets or speed up chemical reactions is vital for drug development, diagnostics and numerous industrial applications, but it is often a protracted and costly process. Research supported by the <a href=\"/centres/jameel-clinic\" target=\"_blank\">Jameel Clinic</a> at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)&nbsp;and conducted by researchers within the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), came up with 'FrameDiff', a computational tool for creating new protein structures beyond what nature has already produced. The approach generates 'frames' that align with the inherent properties of protein structures, enabling it to construct new proteins independently of preexisting designs. This means proteins can attach to other molecules more efficiently and selectively, which can have implications for targeted drug delivery and biotechnology, where it could result in the development of better biosensors. MIT CSAIL student Jason Yim wrote a paper about the work, on which he was advised by MIT Jameel Clinic AI faculty lead <a href=\"/people/regina-barzilay\" id=\"\">Regina Barzilay</a> and principal investigator (2022) <a href=\"/people/tommi-jaakola\" id=\"\">Tommi Jaakkola</a>.</p>",

These initiatives aim to connect youths to employment opportunities, provide income and marketable skills, and discourage risky behaviour. Policymakers hope that these programmes can set young people, particularly from low-income and marginalised backgrounds, on a better path, especially amidst rising juvenile crime rates and concerns about teen mental health. As summer job initiatives have risen nationally across the US, there is a growing body of research evaluation their impacts. Many of these have been run by researchers with the <a href=\"/programme/jameel-poverty-action-lab\">Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab</a> (J-PAL), a social policy research centre based at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

But parsing through large volumes of data to uncover useful information is like searching for a needle in a haystack.

Despite positive progress in reducing extreme poverty and maternal and infant mortality over the past 30 years, recent events like the COVID-19 crisis and the Ukraine war have slowed poverty reduction. Duflo emphasises the globalisation of problems for the poor, while countries tend to close themselves off from global trade opportunities.

Her research calls for innovative approaches to address the complex issues of poverty worldwide.</p>",

The material, made from hydrogel infused with lithium chloride, can swell to make room for more moisture as it absorbs water vapor. Even in very dry conditions with 30 percent relative humidity, the material can pull vapour from the air and hold the moisture without leaking. This transparent, rubbery material has the potential to be used as a passive water harvester in drought-prone regions, where it continuously absorbs vapour that can be condensed into drinking water. Another use is on air conditioning units to improve efficiency and act as a dehumidifier. The material's low cost and high performance make it a promising solution for water scarcity and energy efficiency challenges. The research was led by Carlos Díaz-Marin, an MIT graduate student and member of the Device Research Lab. A study co-authored by J-WAFS&nbsp;principal investigator, Evelyn Wang, was published in a <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202211783\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">paper</a> in <em id=\"\">Advanced Materials.</em><br></p>",

Despite this acknowledgement, studies repeatedly demonstrate that women are less likely to receive appropriate medications, diagnostic tests and clinical procedures for mental health issues across high-, middle- and low-income countries.

One example is an AI tool for assessing lung cancer risk developed by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's <a href=\"/programme/jameel-clinic\" id=\"\">Jameel Clinic</a>.

Instead of relying on \"miracle solutions,\" she advocates for multiple concrete measures that have proven effective. Over the past 30 years, significant progress has been made in reducing extreme poverty worldwide, with the poverty rate decreasing from 15% to 8%.

Duflo and her team have improved policies and programs for over 600 million people, primarily in developing countries. By testing and implementing approaches like providing free mosquito nets to combat malaria and simplifying the water connection process for the poor in Morocco, they have achieved significant positive outcomes.</p><p id=\"\">Duflo aims to challenge the misconception that financial assistance makes people lazy, emphasising that evidence repeatedly disproves this notion.

However, the urban advantage has shrunk in the 21st century due to improvements in height for children in rural areas.

DART VADAR works by detecting small amounts of RNA molecules of target interest within a given sample, even when mixed with larger amounts of other RNA molecules. The development could have important applications in medical diagnosis and treatment, allowing early disease detection. The technology is still in its early stages of development, but Jim Collins and his colleagues are optimistic about its potential.</p>",

In the United States, the Biden administration has publicly called on districts to spend COVID-relief dollars on tutoring. In the United Kingdom, the Department for Education launched the national tutoring programme. These initiatives are excellent steps toward learning recovery, but could fall short of their potential if implementation strays too far from the evidence. Evidence from rigorous evaluations of nearly 100 tutoring programmes demonstrated that tutoring consistently had large, positive impacts on student learning. That said, not all programmes are equally effective.</p>",

The other view is that poverty has gone up post-COVID. What has fuelled this debate is the fact that we don’t have official data on poverty since 2011. What is your view on extreme poverty in India?</strong></p><p id=\"\">‍<br>Esther Duflo (ED): As you note, the data is not there. It’s very difficult to answer these questions in the absence of data. And it’s something that will eventually make it difficult to have an appropriate policy response because it’s really necessary to know what is going on to be able to address the problem. But we are not, at least I am not, better placed than the next person to give you a sense of what might be going on in India on the poverty front since data has not come out for so long.<br>‍</p><p id=\"\">Abhijit Banerjee (AB): I don’t know what could we say. Even the (other) data sets that are available, diverge. That is often the reason for an authoritative survey that’s credible, and politically insulated, to exist. That’s why every country needs those things.<br>‍</p><p id=\"\">ED: India has a long tradition of excellent infrastructure with the national sample survey organization — with the flagship survey, the NSS — but also with various surveys. So we kind of go from having very, very regular data with a consistent sampling frame to this state of affairs, where it’s hard to say.</p><p>‍</p>",

Our parents, presumably in order to protect the maharani from a gaggle of curious children, refused to identify her. So, we tried it on our own. No one was wearing a crown, and the one who came in a tiara was her cousin, a kid assured us, certainly not the queen. Eventually we each made our own picks. Mine was a long-nosed woman in a silver-grey sari, who I heard, in a voice heavily inflected with boredom that I later came to associate with many years of smoking, asking a certain (male) darling to get her another gin and tonic.</p><p id=\"\">I think most of us have had the experience of that New Year’s Eve that was so built up that it was doomed to disappoint.

The number of non-farming businesses (think shops, eating places) associated with these villages is almost a third higher than the villages where no intervention happened, and the number of farming businesses (think poultry, goat-herding) goes up too. As a result, earnings are about 20% higher than in the control villages. The fact that the 12-year UBI money is there for the foreseeable future seems to have made the villagers better able or more willing to take on something new.

For Banerjee, the work is always evolving, always improving, and always reaching more people. You won’t be catching him resting on his laurels anytime soon.</p><p>Banerjee, along with his co-Laureates Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer, are seen as the pioneers of experimental economics. Fueled by randomized controlled trials, an approach similar to clinical trials in medicine, smaller scale experiments are conducted to take specific action on an otherwise complex issue.</p><p>“We often look at millions of people rather than 68 or something,” says Banerjee. “So, it's just an order of magnitude in terms of size that raises many statistical issues and many implementation issues which we need to wrestle with. But in the end, the philosophy is very similar, which is that we want to make sure that we haven't selected the group of beneficiaries in a way different from the way the non-beneficiaries were selected. And therefore, we could legitimately claim that if we see a difference, it's the causal effect of the intervention.”</p>",

That sentence is a bit of a mouthful but it's really what we do,” he says. “We try to encourage people to generate the evidence, but we also then summarize it. When the evidence shows something that's worth scaling, we try to work with policymakers to make that happen.”</p>",

    "summary": "<p id=\"\">Around two million tonnes of pesticides are used globally per year. These poisons break down in the environment into toxic products that contaminate soil, water, turf and other vegetation. The US lags behind other nations in banning these harmful products. Indeed, as an assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), <a href=\"/people/kripa-varanasi\" id=\"\">Kripa Varanasi</a> gave a talk to the US Department of Agriculture, where he sought out the biggest challenge facing USDA representatives. The answer: pesticide runoff from farmland. At the time, Kripa was focused on researching the bottlenecks that occur between states of matter, such as when liquids and solids meet. His aim was to find solutions to make droplets stick to or bounce off solids. Kripa eventually went on to co-found a company, <a href=\"/programme/agzen\">AgZen</a>, that can offer a solution. Invented by MIT mechanical engineering graduate Vishnu Jayaprakash, AgZen's field-tested and patented spray and formulation technology enables agrochemical droplets to stick better to plants, helping farmers to reduce pesticide pollution and save operational costs without compromising on crop yield. AgZen received funding from the <a href=\"/programme/abdul-latif-jameel-water-and-food-systems-lab\" id=\"\">Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab</a> (J-WAFS) Solutions Programme to enable global field tests of the technology and its commercialisation and was the 2022 winner of the J-WAFS&nbsp;World Food Day Video Competition.</p>",

The collective will assist a long-term approach to help convert the food served at UK cultural institutions into a menu that tackles the climate crisis. In 2021, Cooking Sections was nominated for the Turner Prize. They were nominated for the Visible Award for socially active activities and received the Special Prize at the 2019 Future Generation Art Prize. Daniel has been awarded the Harvard GSD Wheelwright Prize for Being Shellfish in 2020.

    "summary": "<p id=\"\">The <a href=\"/programme/abdul-latif-jameel-water-and-food-systems-lab\">Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab</a> (J-WAFS) has awarded the 2022 J-WAFS Solutions Grant to Patrick Doyle, the Robert T Haslam Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT, for his innovative system to tackle water pollution. His project involves a novel use of reusable, sustainable hydrogel microparticles to remove micropollutants from water. The problem of micropollutants, such as plastics derivatives, 'forever chemicals' and heavy metals, is pervasive, as they are present in more than 85% of rivers, ponds and lakes and can cause physiological damage when ingested over time. <br><br>Doyle and his team, which includes his co-principal investigator Rafael Gomez-Bombarelli, assistant professor in materials processing in the department of materials science, will use machine learning to optimise their microparticles, which can be recycled for continuous use. The technology has applications in municipal and industrial water treatment equipment, as well as household products. J-WAFS's USD&nbsp;150K grant will allow the team to build protocols and prototypes and perform market research to develop a potential business plan. This could help millions of people by improving drinking water quality and provide an economically viable solution to the removal of persistent micropollutants.</p>",

In the United States, more than a million people will be diagnosed with the disorder each year, resulting in the loss of motor functions, cognition and memory.

A study by researchers at the UAE University college of agriculture and veterinary medicine, including <a href=\"/people/professor-eihab-fathelrahman\" id=\"\">Eihab Fathelrahman</a>, a visiting scholar at the <a href=\"/programme/jameel-water-and-food-systems-lab\" id=\"\">Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab</a> at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that those surveyed enjoyed the taste of dates at an earlier stage of ripening, which have a lower sugar content, contain more fibre than ripe dates and offer more health benefits, an important consideration in a country with high levels of obesity.</p>",

The project leads are from all five of MIT’s schools and their projects tackle issues delineated in four focus areas: Decarbonised and resilient value chains, circularity and materials, natural carbon sinks and social dimensions and adaptation. The awards are envisioned as a complement to MIT’s 2020 campaign, 'Fast forward: MIT’s climate action plan for the decade', and the upcoming Climate Grand Challenges.

    "excerpt": "<p id=\"\">Giving artisanal flair to modern designs is a feat most designers strive for, and nothing says ‘artisanal’ more than arabesque patterns. Noha Ali, a Swiss-Egyptian product designer, demonstrates through her studio, Naia Design House, how traditional arabesque patterns can be subtly styled on modern home accessories that range from tables and jewelry boxes, to trays with dreamy mother of pearl inlays, without losing their heritage touch. Which led to their displays at Bayt Al-Razzaz Palace during Prince Charles’ recent visit to Egypt in November and the Egyptian Pavilion at Expo 2020.</p><p id=\"\">“They have a soul that is inspired by our heritage and filled with the natural beauty of our local materials,” Ali tells #SceneHome of her handmade home delights. Born and raised in Switzerland, Ali moved to Egypt at the age of 14 and was captivated by its architectural heritage, eventually studying engineering at Ain Shams University before working as a principal architect for a multinational firm, but she soon realized that her passion lies elsewhere. “I wanted to immerse myself in our artisanal heritage and craft contemporary products using traditional design techniques,” she adds.</p>",

    "summary": "<p id=\"\">In the first few weeks of the Ukraine crisis, more than three million people were forced to flee to other countries, most with little more than the clothes on their backs. The speed at which this crisis unfolded is a striking reminder of both the fragility of our lives and how the international community must be ready at any given time to mitigate human suffering. While the conflict in Ukraine is abhorrent, unfortunately it is not isolated. Brutal acts of war are also happening in Syria, Yemen, Libya, and Afghanistan, to name just a few. Rapid and flexible funding is crucial in a situation like Ukraine, and others, where the context is volatile and fast-moving, with multiple neighbouring countries receiving refugees.</p><p id=\"\">The International Rescue Committee (IRC) has developed important funding partnerships with philanthropies across several regions to respond to such situations. In 2020, in response to the combined impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Beirut port explosion, which left an estimated 300,000 people displaced the IRC&nbsp;collaborated with Saudi philanthropy, <a href=\"https://inspire.philanthropyage.org/project-listing/j-pal/\" target=\"_blank\">Community Jameel</a> and Toyota Motor Corporation. A separate partnership with Community Jameel, outlined following a roundtable between the philanthropy’s vice chairman, <a href=\"/team/hassan-jameel\">Hassan Jameel</a>, and IRC president and CEO, David Miliband, scaled up a joint response to COVID-19 transmission for refugees living in Jordan.</p><p id=\"\">The solid support of philanthropic partners like Community Jameel, writes Ourania Dionysiou of the IRC, means that we are not only equipped with the tools to respond to emergencies but, more critically, we are able to test, learn and design innovative solutions to support people affected by crisis and conflict.</p>",

    "summary": "<p id=\"\"><a href=\"/people/samuel-derbyshire\">Samuel Derbyshire</a>, 2023 research fellow at <a href=\"/centres/jameel-observatory\">Jameel Observatory</a>, shares insights and experiences from his field research in the Tarkana region of northern Kenya. He discusses the longstanding environmental challenges facing pastoralist communities in the area and the more recent shift in approach from the research and development communities, to focus not on the resulting uncertainties these challenges bring, but rather on the ways that dryland communities are already managing these uncertainties. Highlighting several examples of effective community response and adaptation, Samuel suggests that the rest of the world may have lessons to learn from Turkana about dealing with environmental, economic and political uncertainties. </p><p>In his essay, Samuel writes, \"Of course, societies across the developed world are not going to abandon industry and commerce to take up semi-nomadic pastoralism any time soon. But this is not the point. The point is that whether we like it or not, many in the west are now charged with the task of remaining productive during a period of environmental, political and economic turbulence that seems more pronounced than ever before. So why not look to Turkana for some guidance?\"</p>",
    "excerpt": "<p id=\"\">Loura Ekaale sits down on his carved wooden stool. He sips a cup of black instant coffee, a substance he has taken to calling his “medicine” (inexplicably, he claims it helps him fall asleep). I have been making it for him each afternoon, with my small gas cooker. This has become a routine for us; he roams over to my canvas tent as the sun begins to set and I boil the kettle. We sit there talking about the day as one of his sons, Lolampa, wanders in from the hills behind us, driving the family’s sheep and goats back into their enclosure.</p><p id=\"\">I have known Loura for almost two years now, during which time I have regularly set up my research camp beside his family home, close to the Loriu Hills in Turkana, northern Kenya. This 68,000 square kilometre arid region is one of the most remote areas in Kenya. To the north is South Sudan and a disputed, lawless section of grazing land called the Ilemi Triangle, claimed by both South Sudan and Kenya. To the west is the homeland of the Karamojong in northern Uganda, and to the east is <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/801/\" id=\"\">Lake Turkana</a> itself, the world’s largest permanent desert lake.</p><p id=\"\">The Turkana region’s southern boundary is the only one connecting it with the rest of Kenya on land, a fact that has led its population to endure a <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Remembering-Turkana-Material-Histories-and-Contemporary-Livelihoods-in/Derbyshire/p/book/9780367431099\" id=\"\">long history</a> of socio-economic and political marginalisation, spanning both the colonial and postcolonial periods. Its population is largely comprised of highly mobile pastoralists – that is, communities who rely on herds of domesticated livestock, which they graze on communal, open range lands.<br></p>"

    "summary": "<p>The plan to shutdown California's Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant by 2025 cites the need for ambitious reductions in carbon emissions amid a changing climate and the shortage of clean power sources. However, Steven Chu and Ernest Moniz, both former US&nbsp;secretary of energy, argue the need revisit this decision and to preserve the plant as part of a larger decarbonisation strategy as the planet faces record temperatures, drought and wildfire destruction. Pointing to an MIT-Stanford study, they encourage critics to consider the potential of repurposing the plant to produce clean hydrogen fuel as well as power sources for water desalination. The collaborative study was co-authored by <a href=\"/programme/abdul-latif-jameel-water-and-food-systems-lab\">Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab</a> director <a href=\"/people/john-lienhard\">John Lienhard</a> and reassessed Diablo Canyon’s potential value for helping California meet the challenges of climate change by providing clean, safe and reliable electricity as well as potentially powering water desalination and hydrogen fuel production. </p><p>The researchers found that an inclusive strategy that preserves the clean electricity from Diablo Canyon will augment new energy generation from renewables and other sources of clean power. Keeping the plant running until 2035 will cut carbon emissions by 11% annually, save ratepayers billions of dollars, and alleviate the need to develop vast amounts of land for renewable energy resources. This is essential in the larger fight against climate change and its effects.</p>",

Researchers at <a href=\"/programme/jameel-clinic\" id=\"\">MIT Jameel Clinic</a> are sensitive to this challenge. As the team develops its AI early-detection breast cancer model, <a href=\"/innovations/mirai\" id=\"\">Mirai</a>, the technology's algorithm is being trained and tested across a diverse set of patient data to ensure its effectiveness on a wide range of patients. According to a paper published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, the model is being tested at seven hospitals around the world, including Brazil, Sweden, Taiwan, Israel, and the US, where the model first introduced at Massachusetts General Hospital.</p><p id=\"\">Testing across a wide set of geographies is important, but painstaking and rare. <a href=\"/people/adam-yala\" id=\"\">Adam Yala</a>, a PhD student at MIT working with <a href=\"/people/regina-barzilay\" id=\"\">Regina Barzilay</a>, MIT&nbsp;Jameel Clinic's faculty lead for artificial intelligence, described some of the challenges associated with securing collaborators and accessing and analysing patient data from the various facilities. Due to regulations in Taiwan's Chang Gung Memorial Hospital whereby patient data is required to remain at the hospital's physical location, Yala traveled to Taipei. 'The only way to validate Mirai on their data was to physically show up, directly login into a machine and do the work on premise,' he noted. </p><p id=\"\">Collecting and analysing these diverse data sets is a worthwhile process that has shown encouraging results in the Mirai's development. Results from Emory University showed Mirai performed similarly across racially distinct patients, which is a crucial indicator in a country where Black women are significantly more at risk of death from breast cancer.</p><p id=\"\">As the team moves to testing Mirai in prospective clinical trials, it plans to make Mirai's code freely accessible to identified hospital systems to enable hospitals to conduct their own studies for local validation ahead of deployment. The team will continue to tackle questions around translating algorithmic risk calculation into effective clinical practice.</p><p id=\"\">'All of our health care systems already capture the biases in some way or another, so how we effectively build systems off generally biased data is a really open challenge,' explained Yala. 'How do you build technologies while making it so that what it is predicting is not regurgitating the past? Finding the thing that's actually going to drive an equitable improvement is an open technical problem. But it's one we can study and we can solve.'</p>",

I think it’s also important to remember that this power plant produces 15 percent of California’s carbon-free electricity today and is responsible for 8 percent of the state’s total electrical production. In other words, Diablo Canyon is a very large factor in California’s decarbonisation.\"</p><p id=\"\">Although the California utility has decided to shut the plant down, John hopes the report will result in a reversal of the decision. He notes, \"we believe that this report gives the relevant stakeholders and policymakers a lot of information about options and value associated with keeping the plant running, and about how California could benefit from clean water and clean power generated at Diablo Canyon. It’s not up to us to make the decision, of course — that is a decision that must be made by the people of California. All we can do is provide information.\"</p>",

    "excerpt": "<p>Artificial intelligence technologies have permeated many aspects of the medical world, enhancing the speed of disease diagnoses, while also introducing chatbots that interact with patients. Since 2017, the scale of AI technologies has grown exponentially, and they have been incorporated to modernise all of the 20th century’s top five disruptive innovations, including telemedicine and robotics, mobile health, basic laboratory biology, improved clinical environments, and health informatics, such as electronic patient records.</p><p>The potential of an AI algorithm to offer pertinent advice in human decision-making is exciting. But we must be mindful not to oversimplify AI or to characterise it as it has been in much of science fiction – as confusingly futuristic or even dystopian. There is a vast and growing ecology of AI algorithms that have distinct capabilities, including classical supervised learning, unsupervised learning, machine learning and deep learning.</p><p>Each so-called species of algorithm has its own place in the digital ecosystem. For example, 90 per cent ofUS Food and Drug Administration approved AI innovations are currently in the field of diagnostics, including the use of mammograms to screen for breast cancer. Beyond screening, the role of point-of-care diagnostics is also particularly amenable to these algorithms, either in the diagnosis of urinary tract infections from an automated read of urine dipsticks or even algorithms to predict heart arrhythmia through smart watches.</p>",

Industrial separation is highly energy intensive, accounting for about 22 percent of total in-plant energy use in the United States. Via Separations' membrane can reduce separation-associated energy use by 90 percent. </p><p id=\"\">Industrial emissions was not the initial target application of the innovation, however. In 2012, MIT professor <a href=\"/people/jeffrey-grossman\" id=\"\">Jeffrey Grossman</a> received a seed fund grant for research on nanoporous membranes in water desalination. As graduate students, Shreya Dave and Brent Keller joined forces in Grossman's lab, fabricating and testing new materials. However, water desalination proved to be the wrong application of the technology for commercialisation. This led the team to examine other opportunities before deciding to target the paper industry, in which the separation process alone accounts for more than two percent of US energy consumption. The project received funding from J-WAFS to explore markets and develop business plans, which supported its pilot launch at a paper company ahead of commercial deployment. \"Our goal is eliminating 500 megatons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050,\" says Shreya. </p>",

Designed by <a href=\"/people/rohit-karnik\">Rohit Karnik</a>, J-WAFS&nbsp;principal investigator and&nbsp;Seed Grant recipient (2015-2023), the filter takes advantage of xylem, which are thin membranes of interconnected conduits found in the non-flowering trees such as pine and ginkgo. These thin membranes act as natural sieves, filtering out bubbles from water and sap. Rohit and his co-researchers have developed filters from white pine branches which have been found to effectively remove E. coli and rotavirus, two common waterborne disease-causing pathogens. </p><p id=\"\">In order to ensure that the filter works effectively, the researchers improved its permeance by soaking the wood in hot water and then dipping it in ethanol to let it dry.</p><p id=\"\">Satisfied that the filter worked in a lab, they took the xylem filters to India in order to understand how it performed in a real-world setting. They designed the filter to meet the ‘two-star comprehensive protection’ criteria set by the World Health Organisation, and found that it removed more than 99% of both the E. coli and rotavirus bacteria.</p><p id=\"\">Rohit and his team are now exploring ways to make xylem filters available at large scale and at an accessible price, observing that users in low-income households preferred paying for their filters in small amounts frequently than an upfront cost. They’ve also launched an open-source website which provides guidelines for designing and fabricating xylem filters from various tree types.</p>",

It took decades for the disease modelling of cholera outbreaks by John Snow, one of the innovators in the field, to be accepted. 150 years on, with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, misinformation and misrepresentation was as prevalent as ever. Faced with innumerable sources of information, it can be difficult for people to distinguish fact from fiction at a time when, in the absence of a vaccine, information and public health measures were the only tools available to stop COVID-19 transmission. The upshot is that evidence-based science and expert experience in responding to pandemics are critical.

The district opened the challenge to technology and academic leaders in what they called 'a three-month hackathon-style initiative'. The winner, a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), produced an algorithm that would do just what BPS wanted: Improve the routing system from a cost, efficiency and community engagement perspective. The algorithm was devised by doctoral students Arthur Delarue and Sébastien Martin as part of a team with <a href=\"/people/dimitris-bertsimas\">Dimitris Bertsimas</a>, faculty lead of entrepreneurship at MIT <a href=\"/programme/jameel-clinic\" id=\"\">Jameel Clinic</a> and MIT’s Operations Research Centre. </p><p id=\"\">Dimitris' team ran data received from the the school district along with data from Google Maps, students’ addresses, school start times and Boston traffic patterns, and produced an algorithm that would generate the best routes, strategically reconfigure bus stops, maximise the number of students riding each bus and reduce the amount of time buses travel when no students are on board. Two years later, the number of trips district buses have to make are down by almost 400 and the system is 20% more efficient. The new model of bus routing also saved the school system millions of dollars that could be re-invested back into schools.</p>",

In particular, the sensor could benefit aquaculture by monitoring water quality and improving fish farming practices.

One program tested in Kenya jumped out, and the Rwandan government wanted to know whether it would likely work in Rwanda as well. “Sugar Daddies Risk Awareness,” an HIV-prevention program, was remarkably effective in reducing a key means of HIV transmission: sexual relationships between teenage girls and older men. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) found that showing eighth-grade girls and boys a 10-minute video and statistics on the higher rates of HIV among older men dramatically changed behavior: The number of teen girls who became pregnant with an older man within the following 12 months fell by more than 60 percent.<sup id=\"\">1</sup></p><p id=\"\">This study was compelling partly because of its methodology: Random assignment determined which girls received the risk awareness program and which girls continued to receive the standard curriculum. Our government partners could thereby have confidence that the reduction in risky behavior was actually caused by the program. But if they replicated this approach in a new context, could they expect the impact to be similar?</p><p>Policy makers repeatedly face this generalizability puzzle—whether the results of a specific program generalize to other contexts—and there has been a long-standing debate among policy makers about the appropriate response. But the discussion is often framed by confusing and unhelpful questions, such as: Should policy makers rely on less rigorous evidence from a local context or more rigorous evidence from elsewhere? And must a new experiment always be done locally before a program is scaled up?</p>"

To counter this, the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves was formed in 2010 and sought to get 100 million homes to adopt so-called 'clean stoves' by 2020 to improve health, reduce fuel costs and limit environmental hazards. A recent <a href=\"/publications/up-in-smoke-the-influence-of-household-behaviour-on-the-long-run-impact-of-improved-cooking-stoves\" id=\"\">study</a> by economist <a href=\"/people/esther-duflo\" id=\"\">Esther Duflo </a>and her colleagues <a href=\"/people/dr-rema-hanna\" id=\"\">Rema Hanna</a> within the <a href=\"/programme/jameel-poverty-action-lab\" id=\"\">Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab </a>(J-PAL) at MIT, tested the efficacy of clean stoves in real-world conditions in Odisha, India and found that most cooking stoves distributed in their trial were eventually abandoned. The study found that acceptance and, crucially, usage, of a new stove was not universal even initially, and usage declined rapidly over time, as stoves broke down and households failed to make the necessary repairs or investment in maintenance.<br><br>In some cases, households who volunteered for the study refused to receive the new stoves, and those who got them often used them alongside their old stove until it eventually broke. Not only this, the health benefits were not conclusive. While the study showed some health improvements for the primary cook in the household during the first year after installation, the effect vanished over time as proper use and maintenance of the new stove declined. The study prompted discussions about whether redirected resources should be prioritised to programmes with stronger evidence of efficacy such as conditional cash transfers, bed nets and deworming.</p>",
