# Understanding Async/Await in JavaScript

Async/await is a modern way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. It is built on top of Promises and allows you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous fashion.

## Introduction

To understand async/await, we first need to understand Promises. Here's a brief overview:

```javascript
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Success!");
  }, 1000);
});

promise.then((value) => {
  console.log(value); // "Success!"
});
